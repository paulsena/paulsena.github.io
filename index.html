                    <p class="lead">Software developer, musician, traveler, photographer.</p>
                    <p >Hi, I'm Paul.  I'm a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast that loves my craft.  In the past I've specalized in Mid and Back end development in Javascript, C#, and Java.  I'm also an expert in Integration and Web Services (SOA). Currently, I'm interested in learning Big Data and Javascript frameworks (Node.js, Angluar).  I've also always had a side passion for electronics based projects and robotics.  My future learning topics include AI, ML, and NLP.</p>
                    <p>Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated with science, technology, and how things work. I started programming with Qbasic when I was 13 years old and making some interesting games. In high school I joined FIRST Robotics and was engaged in bot competitions. In 2005, I started working in the Computer industry as QA software tester and moved my way up to developer and consultant. In 2009, I went back to University of Massachusetts as a non traditional full time day student (while working) to finish my B.S. in CS degree and graduated in 2012 with honors which was a great accomplishment for me. Another great acomplishment for me during that time was joining the crew team my last semester. I was an old dude rowing in a boat competitvely, never have done it before, with kids years youngers than me. These days with my free time outside of work, I'm always tinkering with some new tech framework or coding side project, attending hackathons and meetup.com events, and writing ideas in my journal, dreaming of creating my own startup someday.</p>
                    <p>Some other things about me:
                    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                    	<li><b>I'm a bass guitarist.</b> I've been in various bands over the years, writing original music and performing in dozens of Boston venues.</li>
                    	<li><b>I'm a travel junkie.</b> I've lived overseas for almost a year and a half in South American and Europe with nothing but a carry on bag and my laptop.</li>
                    	<li><b>I'm a language enthusiast</b>; During my overseas living, I found my passion for communicating in local tounge. Through a basic instinct of not starving to death, internet self teachings, and trial n' error of making a fool of myself to locals, I learned. I'm currently conversational in Portuguese, and basic in Italian. <i>"If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart." - Nelson Mandela.</i> </li>
                    	<li><b>I'm a motorcycle gear head.</b> I have been riding on two wheels since I was 12, starting with mopeds. My first vehicle was a motorcycle not a car when I turned 18! It was an old 1986 Honda Interceptor VF500F, a legend of a bike. Recently, I just switched to my first cruiser and am loving it!</li>
                    	<li><b>I'm a wanna be photographer.</b> I discovered I might have an eye for the hobby after traveling to Sri Lanka and taking some really nice <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/112631592343673409054/SriLankaScenery?authuser=0&feat=directlink" target="_blank">composition shots</a> with a simple point and shoot. For my South American travels, I bought a DSLR and have loved it ever since! I day dream of being a photographer for National Geographic, traveling to remote locations to get that perfect shot.</li>
                    	<li><b>I'm a fitness rat.</b> I started by winning a free year membership to a local gym through a body re-composition challenge in 09'. I dropped 8% body fat in two months. I was instantly hooked and loved the feeling of eating healthier and heavy compound movement lifts. I spent hours consuming every bit of bro science on the internet I could. Since then, I've laxed up a little on the diet because I love food too much ;)</li>
                    </ul>

											    <p><img src="img/laquo.png"/> Innovative, consistent, and knowledgeable that's how I would describe Paul. As a project manager when I look to assemble a project team, of course I want the "A" team. You quickly find that the best of the best are always over allocated. Paul was consistently 100% utilized. That speaks volume when every PM requests a particular resource. Our success is predicated on the experience, the flexibility, and the ability of our team members to solve customer problems. Paul is head and shoulders above the pack. I've managed over 80 project implementations, Paul has been on several of them and delivered every time. I strongly recommend Paul.</p>

													<p><img src="img/laquo.png"/> Paul and I first worked together at Zantaz and from that experience I recruited him to work with me at McGladrey. Considering that Zantaz was a mature product company and McGladrey a mature consulting company, Paul's ability to work in both environments is itself impressive. Beyond that, Paul is an exceptionally bright and talented developer. He has a passion for solving problems and learning new technologies and is an amazingly quick learner. Paul is affable and easy to work with. He does a great job of balancing direct feedback with being a team player. Paul is a high quality professional, and more importantly a high quality person, and one that I highly recommend.</p>

													<p><img src="img/laquo.png"/> I worked directly with Paul and both Autonomy/Zantaz and McGladrey. Both times I was thoroughly impressed with Paul's ability to handle any task that is thrown at him. He is an extremely quick learner and has a vast breadth of software engineering skills. He is able to communicate very complex technical topics to a broad, sometime less technical, audience. If my company were to open a development position fitting a sub-set Paul's skills, I would not hesitate to reach out to him and try to hire him.</p>

Throughout a number of customer engagements, he was considered a core member of the team, always providing a deliverable that exceeded expectations. His willingness to take on new technology, to ultimately provide the best product possible, was always met with open arms.</p>
